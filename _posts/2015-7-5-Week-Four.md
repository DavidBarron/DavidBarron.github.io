I just realized we're a bit over halfway through the semester. Time just seems to be flying by. We had our first exam on Monday and it actually went very well. I guess all the preparation and stressing about going through every piece of code we covered in class and rewriting different versions of functions we've looked at paid off; I was able to get through the first five questions of the exam without much trouble. The last question (rewriting our own version of the zip function) did have me stumped for a while, however. I think I sat there scribbling notes on how I could possibly handle an unspecified number of iterables for twenty minutes.  

If exams aren't enough to stress you out, then how about group projects? I think most people prefer having people you can fall back on and help get you through something you are having trouble with, but given that I'm more of a "glass half empty" kind of person I always worry that I'll end up in a dysfunctional group or worse, not doing my fair share of the work and letting my group down. Thankfully, so far everyone in my group seems to be working great together. We chose as our topic a simple NFL web app that displays various info about Divisions, Teams, and Players since we figured it wouldn't be hard to gather information pertaining to each thing. Something we did not consider, and maybe we should have, is that each team has 90 players on its roster, so that means we're looking at 2880 different players we need to scrape data for... 

### Tip of the week

If you're not very knowledgeable in web scraping (like myself) and the tutorials online for things like Scrapy or BeautifulSoup seem too lengthy for you (like for me), then you might make use of online tools like Import.io. This is a pretty good tool if the data you are trying to retrieve is already formatted in a chart or table, just paste the link to the website and it will extract the data to a CSV or JSON for you.
