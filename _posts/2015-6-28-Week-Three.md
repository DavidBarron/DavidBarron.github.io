title: Week Three
---

So this week was basically the calm before the storm. The first exam is tomorrow and to say I’m feeling a bit anxious is not entirely doing my current mood justice. From the various things I have heard of Professor Downing’s exams, it’s guaranteed that they are the most difficult part of his classes. Coupled with the fact that they are the largest percentage of our grade and none are dropped, there’s no room for error.

The week started out well enough. I was a little worried about our second project since we would only get four school days and a weekend to complete it, and the majority of my weekend would be occupied with my parents in town. My worries proved to be unsubstantiated however as I was able to finish the project in a couple of days, and in fact most of my time was spent creating cache files from the training sets we were supplied with. The actual algorithm for creating Netflix rating predictions with a Root Mean Square Error below 1 was described in one of the articles Professor Downing posted. Which just goes to show how important reading all of the class material can be, otherwise I think I would have been stuck for a while there. But that’s a different story.

Of course, that fun didn’t last long and as soon as we turned in project 2 we were already getting our feet wet with project 3. We had a guest speaker come in and talk about spinning up a VM with Rackspace, as well as about his experience working for Rackspace and his life as a software engineer in general. The technical side of the presentation brought back a few painful flashbacks for my Big Data Processing class and having to spin up Hadoop clusters on AWS to run our programs. It took somewhere between ten to fifteen minutes to get some kind of output back, assuming there were no errors in your code. So fingers crossed we won’t have to be going through something like that again.

### Tip of the Week

Our Netflix project and using past mean ratings to predict future ratings reminded me of a site I recently came across that dealt with “Collective Intelligence”. It’s a bit light on details but there are various blog style entries and videos to watch that I found interesting.
